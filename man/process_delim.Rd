\title{A function to read in large data files as an FBM}
\usage{
process_delim(
  file,
  data_dir,
  rds_dir = data_dir,
  bk_filename,
  ind.col,
  unpen = NULL,
  outfile,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The file to be read in, without the filepath. This should be a file of numeric values, no header row!
Headers should be taken out of the file and supplied to the \code{col_names} argument in \code{plmm()}
Example: use \code{file = "myfile.txt"}, not \code{file = "~/mydirectory/myfile.txt"}}

\item{data_dir}{The directory to the file}

\item{rds_dir}{The directory where the user wants to create the '.rds' and '.bk' files
Defaults to \code{data_dir}}

\item{bk_filename}{Optional string to name the backingfile that will be created for the output data. Defaults to \verb{paste0(std_}. \code{prefix}).
\strong{Note}: Do NOT include a \code{.bk} extension in the filename.}

\item{ind.col}{Numeric vector of the columns to read in. Don't use negative indicies.
If you're not sure how many columns are in your file,
use something like \code{data.table::fread()} to examine the first row or two.}

\item{unpen}{Numeric vector with indices of columns that have non-genomic information. \strong{Note}: if you plan on
estimating the genomic relatedness among observations in your file, you
\strong{must} include this information in order for the estimates to be correct.}

\item{outfile}{Optional: the name (character string) of the prefix of the
logfile to be written. Defaults to 'process_delim', i.e. you will get 'process_delim.log' as the outfile.}

\item{overwrite}{Optional: the name (character string) of the prefix of the logfile to be written.
Defaults to 'process_plink', i.e. you will get 'process_plink.log' as the outfile.
\strong{Note}: If there are multiple \code{.rds} files with names that start with "std_prefix_...", \strong{this will error out}.
To protect users from accidentally deleting files with saved results, only one \code{.rds} file can be removed with this option.}

\item{quiet}{Logical: should the messages printed to the console be silenced? Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned by this function, but (at least) two files are created in
the location specified by \code{rds_dir}:
\itemize{
\item 'std_prefix.rds': This is the \code{bigsnpr::bigSNP} object
that holds the PLINK data along with meta-data. See details for explanation of what
is included in this meta-data
\item 'std_prefix.bk': Created by the call to \code{standardize_fbm()}, this is the
backingfile that stores the numeric data of the standardized design matrix \code{std_X}
}
